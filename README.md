# II.	User Interface Overview


## 1.1 Professor Portal
### Professor Dashboard
In the professor dashboard, users can not only set room schedule reservations but also view their schedules throughout the day. This helps them track their reserved time slots and efficiently manage their activities.
Located at the lower part of the dashboard, you will find a set of menu options specifically designed to assist users in navigating and utilizing the application effectively.

We will be automatically on the Home button by default since it serves as the entry point to the professor's dashboard, which offers a range of features for professors. From the dashboard, they can view their schedules for the day and access additional productivity tools. It provides an intuitive and organized interface, facilitating efficient task management and enhancing the teaching experience.

The Add button is prominently displayed to facilitate the reservation process. By clicking on this button, users can easily initiate the reservation workflow, which will be further elaborated on in a later section of the user manual. The Add button serves as a convenient starting point for users to create new reservations and specify their desired schedule parameters.

The Notifications button plays a crucial role in keeping users informed about their scheduled reservations. By clicking on this button, users can access a dedicated notification center or panel. This feature ensures that users receive timely alerts or reminders as their reserved time slots approach. Notifications may include reminders about upcoming reservations, updates regarding any changes to their schedules, or important announcements related to their reservations.

The Settings button provides professors with access to basic account preferences and essential information regarding the application. By clicking on this button, professors can conveniently navigate to a settings or preferences page where they can customize their account settings as per their preferences. Additionally, the Settings button allows professors to access the application's privacy policy and terms and conditions. These documents outline the guidelines, rights, and responsibilities associated with using the application, ensuring transparency and compliance with applicable regulations.

### 1.2 Add button process and functionalities
Building & Floor Selection
Upon clicking the add button, you will be seamlessly redirected to a series of screens to facilitate the room reservation process. The first screen will present you with the option to choose the desired building from the campus where you intend to reserve a room. This allows you to select the specific building that best suits your needs or location preferences.

After selecting the building, you will be guided to the floor selection screen. Here, you can choose the preferred floor within the selected building. If, by chance, all the rooms on the initially chosen floor are occupied, you will be presented with the opportunity to select an alternative floor instead. This ensures that you can still find an available room that meets your requirements.

Registered Subject Selection
Once you have chosen the floor, the screen will prompt you to select the subject for which you wish to make the reservation. It's important to note that the subject selection screen will only display the subjects that are currently being taught or handled by you as the professor. Alongside the subject, you will also see the preset time and course associated with each subject, providing clarity and convenience during the reservation process.

Available Rooms Selection
After selecting the subject, the screen will guide you to choose the specific room you prefer to reserve. This will allow you to browse and select from the available rooms within the chosen building and floor. You can evaluate factors such as room capacity, amenities, or any specific requirements based on your teaching needs.

Once you have made your room selection, a confirmation prompt will appear on the screen. This confirmation step ensures that you have reviewed and verified your reservation details accurately before finalizing the process. It serves as a final checkpoint to prevent any unintended errors or discrepancies.

## 2.1 Guard Portal
### Guard Dashboard
Once you log in as a Guard (officially known as the Lobby Attendant) in the application, you will be instantly redirected to the Guard Dashboard. This dashboard serves as your central control panel and provides valuable information right from the start.

The Guard Dashboard prominently displays the "Current Room Reservation List," which offers a real-time overview of the rooms that are currently occupied. This feature enables you, as a Guard, to be promptly informed of the rooms that are currently in use by professors. It helps you stay updated and effectively manage the campus premises by being aware of the room occupancy status.

To facilitate your monitoring duties, the Guard Dashboard also grants you access to a search functionality. This search feature allows you to easily search for a specific professor's name, along with their subject and course. This functionality streamlines the search process, making it convenient for you to quickly locate the information you need, such as the assigned room or schedule for a particular professor.

At the lower part of the dashboard, you will find a set of additional functionalities specifically designed to support your monitoring responsibilities.

The Home button serves as the default landing page and dashboard of the Guard Portal. It provides essential functionalities for monitoring and administrative purposes, as mentioned earlier in the Guard Portal manual.

### Room Reservation History 
The History button is available for you to access the History page. By clicking on this button, you will be redirected to a dedicated page where you can view the reservation history for a specific date. This feature allows you to review past reservations, helping you keep track of room usage and maintain records. Additionally, on the History page, you will find an "Export File" button, which allows you to export the records of the chosen date into a file format for further analysis or documentation.

Next, the Notifications button serves as an alert system, notifying you of important events related to room reservations. When a professor either enters the room or encounters an issue, such as entering the wrong room or being absent for the day, these alerts will pop up as notifications. This feature allows you to stay vigilant and efficiently respond to any unexpected situations or discrepancies that may arise.

### User Management
The Settings button in the Guard Portal offers additional functions compared to the professor portal. It includes basic account preference settings and a "View Users" function for administrative monitoring. It also provides access to the privacy policy statement, ensuring compliance with data protection regulations.
